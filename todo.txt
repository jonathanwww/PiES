TODO
faster evaluation than eval, numexpr
multi process on solving grids
add rules for syntax highlighting for eq window and python window. Perhaps based on the validation system

BUGS
Loop var/param var after normal var with same name does not override
a-2=5 makes param var with a-2 name
find_all_variables will bug if eq contains more than one equal sign
